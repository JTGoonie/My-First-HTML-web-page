                <h2>Weapon Stats</h2>
                <p>Compared to alot of the other Pulse Rifles in the game, Outbreak Perfected stands above the rest in a few key ways. It has superb handling for the adaptive frame architype <em>Most others in it's class sit around ~27</em> which allows this weapon to stay on airborn targets. It does have a slightly below average impact value at only 27, but the <a href="#Perks">Exotic Trait</a> will make up for the rest of the damage</p>

                <h2>Perks</h2>
                    <p>Compared to other Exotic Pulse Rifles such as: Vigilance Wing and Graviton Lance, this weapon has a set of perks that allow this pulse rifle to excell in the Adaptive Frame catergory. it has the potential to be a highly versatile multipurpose weapon in the hands of a player with good aim. In PVE, the weapon can clear groups of enemies with relative ease, and can deal considerable damage to boss enemies once enough nanites attach to them, especially in a full fireteam of Outbreak Perfected users.</p>

                    <p>The catalyst for Outbreak Perfected was previously obtained and completed through successive clears of Heroic Zero Hour, a higher difficulty version of the Zero Hour mission. Since the release of Beyond Light, Zero Hour is no longer present in the game, so the catalyst has now become a playlist activity reward.</p>
                    <p><em>(Once obtained, players need to perform 500 kills with Outbreak Perfected to unlock the catalyst trait.)</em></p>

                        <p>The Captain stands with his primary hands braced on a command table. He stares down at a static holoprojection as though it might reveal some new secrets. Nearby, the Hunter combs through scout reports. The Warlock taps rapidly at a datapad, running simulation after simulation. No one speaks.</p>
                        <p>There is a deafening boom. The holoprojection flickers; the whole Skiff tilts seventy degrees off-kilter. The Captain holds tight to the table, reaching out with a secondary arm to snatch the Hunter as he goes toppling by. The Warlock is not a concern; she has Blinked her way to a secure handhold.</p>
                        <p>The Captain calls to his crew, speaking Eliksni too fast for the Hunter or the Warlock to follow. Someone calls back. The Skiff tilts nauseously, then stabilizes.</p>
                        <p>“Eramis?” the Warlock asks.</p>
                        <p>The Captain nods. Letting go of the Hunter, he disappears through an access hatch to consult with his new crew.</p>
                        <p>“I don’t like this,” the Hunter says lowly. “We should be there with him.”</p>
                        <p>The Warlock chews on her lower lip. She doesn’t like it either, but they’ve argued endlessly with their Captain and gained no ground. ”We have to trust him,” she says finally. “This is what he wants.”</p>
                        <p>“Trust him to die?” the Hunter hisses. “Let’s break down how stupid this is: not only does he wants to infiltrate the Tower without us, he’s planning to wear Devils colors to interrupt a Devils heist to reclaim SIVA. And instead of leaning on us, his good Guardian friends, he’s banking on some stranger –“</p>
                        <p>“Not a stranger,” the Warlock cuts in.</p>
                        <p>“Fine! Not a stranger, but definitely not a friend!” The Hunter grits his teeth. “We should do it. We need to do it. Let’s just go; let’s go now. We can cut them off.” He conjures his Ghost with a twist of his wrist, readying for transmat.</p>
                        <p>“We have to trust him,” the Warlock repeats, reaching out to grasp the Hunter’s forearm. “I think he’s right when he says it doesn’t mean anything if we do it. Guardians do extraordinary things all the time. And he needs more allies…”</p>
                        <p>The Captain reenters their little ad-hoc war room. They draw up guiltily. The Hunter hides his Ghost.</p>
                        <p>“All well?” he asks, looking between them.</p>
                        <p>“Eia, Mithrax,” the Warlock murmurs. “We’re all good.”</p>
                        <p>The Hunter says nothing.</p>
                        <p>“We walk this hardship-path with joyful hearts. Be brave.”</p>
